Introduction:
	As an avid Counter-Strike player, I’ve always sought ways to improve my gameplay. After spending some time learning Python through JetLearn, I began to realize that I could apply my coding skills to enhance my gaming experience. 	My curiosity led me to wonder: What if I could create my own aimbot using object detection techniques?

	The concept of aimbots intrigued me, but most existing solutions were based on manipulating RAM, which was hard to understand and didn’t align with my learning goals. Instead, I wanted to explore a more elegant and innovative 	approach. That's when I stumbled upon YOLOv5, a public object detection library in Python, which seemed like the perfect tool to detect players in real-time. Using this library, I could detect enemy players, track their positions, 	and then use Python to simulate mouse movements and clicks to automatically aim and shoot.

Problems Solved:
	Problem with Traditional Aimbots:

		Traditional aimbots typically work by directly manipulating RAM to change in-game data.

		These approaches were hard to understand and required in-depth knowledge of memory manipulation, which wasn’t something I wanted to delve into for this project.

	Detecting Players in a Game Using Object Detection:

		The first challenge was finding a method to accurately detect enemy players in the game.

		After some research, I found YOLOv5, a robust object detection library, which could detect players based on custom-trained models.

		The challenge was in feeding YOLOv5 my own data to detect players reliably in the game environment.

	Moving the Mouse Cursor:

		Once the player was detected, I needed a way to move the mouse cursor towards the player’s position on the screen.

		Initially, I had difficulty finding a suitable Python library for mouse movement because Counter-Strike uses raw input for mouse events, making it tricky to manipulate the cursor directly.

		After further research, I discovered the win32API library, which allows for low-level control of the mouse position in Windows. This solved my problem of moving the cursor to the detected player.

	Simulating Mouse Clicks to Shoot:

		After moving the mouse to the target location, the next step was simulating a mouse click to shoot the enemy.

		I used pyautogui, a Python library, to simulate mouse clicks after positioning the cursor correctly.

	Bug Fix - Mouse Positioning Issue:

		I ran into a bug where the mouse wouldn’t move to the correct location on the screen.

		After hours of troubleshooting, I realized that win32API moves the mouse relative to the screen resolution, but YOLOv5 uses a smaller resolution for image detection.

		To fix this, I upscaled the coordinates generated by YOLOv5 based on my monitor’s resolution, ensuring that the mouse would move to the correct location in the game.

Conclusion:
Through this project, I was able to combine my interests in gaming and coding, ultimately creating a functioning aimbot that leverages Python, YOLOv5 object detection, and mouse control libraries. This project not only helped me improve my gaming skills but also provided hands-on experience with real-time image processing, object detection, and automation.
